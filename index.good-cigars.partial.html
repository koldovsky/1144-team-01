      Our modern and well-equipped cigar factories in Cuba do not rely solely on
      technologies. On the contrary, the making of cigars still requires human
      skills. Our employees are engaged in a craft and are supported by modern
      technologies.

      QUALITY THAT CAN'T BE OVERESTIMATED
    </h3>
    <p class="good-cigars-seed-quality__description">
      Before a wrapper is wound around a cigar, it passes through at least three
      hundred pairs of hands. You can trace the journey of your cigar from the
      tobacco leaf or even seed to the boxed cigar. We use the most modern
      approaches and only natural ingredients.
